# IR-on-coin-datasets
This is an Image Recognition approach on the Corpus Nummorum dataset. You can predict coin types and mints on coin images (obverse and reverse).
Currently, we only have a Colab Notebook here. You can try our approach for yourself with it. If you have any problems or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
