Since the model is only trained for CN coins, it is recommended to use only coin photos of the ancient landscapes treated there.\n","#@markdown You can get coin images from www.corpus-nummorum.eu. Alternatively, we provide several coin photos from our test set here.\n","\n","#@markdown If you want to use your own images, you can choose obverse and reverse of a coin separate with the \"Select Obverse/Reverse\" button from your local drive. Afterwards, you have to click the \"Upload\" Button.\n","#@markdown You can also delete the uploaded files and the whole session with the respective button. The dropdown menus below contain the uploaded images. You can combine the matching images, if you \n","#@markdown have uploaded several coins. For a prediction of a coin you must click the \"Predict Type/Mint\" buttons. \"Predict Type\" will show you up to \n","#@markdown five types which were predicted by our model. \n","\n","#@markdown The first image shows you how your uploaded images were processed by our approach (called \"Combined source image). Both images are concatenated and the brought into a\n","#@markdown quadratic format. After that, the results of the type prediction are shown in order of probability. You will get the CN Type ID, the respective probability of the prediction, a link to that type and \n","#@markdown a preview of that type in comparison to your image. Probabilities are given in decimal numbers. The higher the number, the more confident the model is. Despite a high probability, such a result can also be wrong. \n","#@markdown Values like \"1.0\" are the result of rounding processes during the execution of the prediction. Very small probabilities can occur as well, for example \"5.965622e-10\". This expression represents a   \n","#@markdown number where you have to shift the decimal point ten positions to the left. If you click the \"Predict Mint\" button, you will get up to five results and their links for a coin image like in the type \n","#@markdown prediction. Because our mints have a lot of associated types there is no preview image for them.\n","\n","#@markdown It should be noted that only 134 out of 19,000 types are currently trained in this model due to lack of training images. The mint prediction, on the other hand, includes 88 of 92 available mints of\n","#@markdown the CN dataset. The predicted mint results should be more accurate for most coins.\n","# If you want to provide us with feedback to this Colab notebook pls do something....\n","\n","uploader_obv =
